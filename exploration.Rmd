## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
#view heads

head(polls)
head(electoralvotes)

#merge data
merged <- left_join(
  electoralvotes, 
  polls, 
  by = "state")

head(merged)   # visualize merged data

# keep only most recent polling average and only Biden and Trump
today <- Sys.Date()
merged_clean <- filter(merged, is.na(modeldate) | modeldate == "8/31/20")

merged_clean <- filter(merged_clean, 
                       is.na(candidate_name) |
                       candidate_name == "Joseph R. Biden Jr." |
                         candidate_name == "Donald Trump")

head(merged_clean)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
data <- filter(merged, candidate_name == "Joseph R. Biden Jr." | is.na(candidate_name)

ggplot(data, aes(x = votes_2010, color = pct_trend_adjusted)) + geom_histogram(color = "black", fill = "blue", alpha = 0.5,  binwidth = 1) + labs(x = "Electoral Votes 2010", y = "Number of States")
 
ggplot(data, aes(x = votes_2020, color = pct_trend_adjusted)) + 
  geom_histogram(color = "black", fill = "blue", alpha = 0.5,  
                 binwidth = 1, labs=)

a <- na.omit(merged_clean)

ggplot(a, aes(x = candidate_name, y = pct_trend_adjusted)) +
  geom_boxplot(notch=TRUE, alpha=0.8) +
  labs(title="Weighted Mean Polling Average By State", x="Candidate", y="Polling Average") +
  ylim(25,75)

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
